# elephant-in-the-room
A collection of snapshots from different systems illustrating allocation patterns near the beginning of storage devices. Images are provided as-is, without annotations or labels, to show real-world observations.

In both qualitative and quantitative analyses of this data,
we may debate methods or exact measurements, *but* 
can we, with full confidence, dismiss these observations as inconclusive?
